# Test-linked Agentic Chains

Test-linked Agentic Chains (tac) combines the methodical approach of tested development with blockchain-inspired interlinking mechanisms, creating a robust framework where AI systems are developed and validated through continuous empirical testing. 

> **Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
> This project is in **alpha**. Interfaces, commands, and features may change without notice. Use at your own risk and carefully test before deploying in production environments.

## What Is It?

Test-linked Agentic Chains (tac) extends the principles of continuous testing and auditing into AI development. By structuring tasks as "blocks" validated by a series of automated tests and recorded changes, you can iteratively refine your AI's behavior while maintaining a transparent trail of its evolution. For a detailed technical overview of the system architecture and methodology, please refer to our [whitepaper](docs/whitepaper.md).

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone this repository** (or download it) to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lunarring/tac.git
   cd tac
   ```

2. Activate your environment (e.g., mine is called 'good'):
   ```bash
   conda activate good
   ```

3. Install via pyproject.toml‚Äîeither in editable mode for development or standard mode for production:

   Editable (development) mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
4. Be sure you have a valid API key for OpenAI in your system that can be retrieved by `os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')`
## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Usually, you are running tac from your terminal and are within your project root. You need git to run tac.

### Create and Execute Tasks
Execute tasks including automated testing using a simple command:

```bash
# Execute a task with specific instructions
tac make "your instructions here"

# Examples:
tac make "add error handling to function parse_config"

# Optional: Specify a different directory (default is current directory)
tac make "your instructions" --dir ./your/code/directory

# Optional: Load from a JSON protoblock file
tac make --json path/to/protoblock.json
```

### Git integration

TAC will make a new branch with an id, e.g. tac_aa0cb8, where it will commit all changes IF everything worked out. 
Otherwise you'll have to manually switch back to your previous branch.


### Voice Interface (Experimental)

TAC now includes an experimental voice interface that allows you to interact with the system using speech:

```bash
tac voice
```

The voice interface allows you to:
- Speak your task instructions naturally
- Get audio feedback from the AI assistant
- Execute the same operations as the text-based interface
- Maintain a conversational flow while coding (coming soon)

> **Note**: The voice interface is currently experimental and may require additional setup for speech recognition and synthesis.

### View Blocks and Logs

View blocks and execution logs interactively:

```bash
tac view
```

This command provides an interactive interface to:
- Browse and inspect protoblocks with their versions and specifications
- View execution logs with test results and changes
- See block details including task specifications, test data, and file changes

### Test Management

The framework provides several test-related commands:

```bash
# Run tests
tac test run [--directory tests]

# List available tests
tac test list [--directory tests]

# Generate tests (coming soon)
tac test generate
```

### Gather Code Documentation

The gather command helps collect and document Python files in a directory:

```bash
tac gather ./src/tac
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The framework uses a built-in configuration system with sensible defaults that can be overridden via command-line arguments:

```bash
# Example: Override configuration values
tac make "your task" --plausibility-test false --max-retries 5
```

All configuration options are documented in the command help:
```bash
tac make --help
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing

Since this project is alpha, contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are highly encouraged. Ideally get in touch with Johannes, as the project currently is in closed alpha stage.
